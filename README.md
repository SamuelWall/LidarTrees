Over the past 3 semesters of my studies, I have been studying machine learning and data analysis with 
Professor Michael Grossberg and gaining a solid understanding for how research works in academia. 
After some work in computational fluid dynamics, our research was pivoted to using machine 
learning to help with climate change. The main goal of this research is to develop an algorithm 
instituting machine learning to estimate biomass and carbon levels of forests through video. 
These measurements are important as biomass relates directly with carbon percentage stored in 
trees, giving insight into the environmental impact a forest has on the local and global 
environment. Ordinarily, biomass of forests is estimated through tedious measurements of 
individual trees with measuring tapes and approximating the entire forest using a smaller sample 
size. By developing a way to autonomize these measurements, we hope to expediate the process 
of forest sampling while trying to improve the accuracy of the measurements taken. Some 
research questions that we will consider are the accuracy of standard RGB images against RGBD images in estimating these values, how different machine learning models to be used and trained compare to other ways of taking measurements, and the capability of an algorithm trained 
on artificial images to classify real world images
